TLDR; This is a React Project of CRUD operation using AXIOS and MOCKAPI.
- axios is used to make requests and mockapi to create an endpoint(API).
- The project includes a basic form which takes the data and inserts it in the endpoint and the table of of already existing users is shown under the form. 
- The edit and delete is provided in each table rows by clicking on edit the data is trasffered to the form's text field and the 'insert' button's text changes to 'edit data' from there the 'put' request is made to the endpoint.
- The delete is quite simple, just makes the delete request to the endpoint.
